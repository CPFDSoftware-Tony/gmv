NETCDF

The exodusII library uses the netcdf library for low-level data
storage.

ExodusII requires NetCDF version 3.6.0 or later with the "large-model
modifications". 

The netcdf library must be modified slightly in order to handle the
exodusII datamodel. The specific changes are:

1. src/libsrc/netcdf.h -- Modify the following defines:

#define NC_MAX_DIMS	65536	 /* max dimensions per file */
#define NC_MAX_VARS	524288	 /* max variables per file */
#define NC_MAX_VAR_DIMS	8        /* max per variable dimensions */

2. src/ncdump/ncdump.c -- Due to the increased sizes above, the 'dims'
and 'vdims' arrays are malloc'd instead of static arrays which fail
with the increased sizes.

> #else
>     struct ncdim *dims;               /* dimensions */
>     size_t *vdims;            /* dimension sizes for a single variable */
> #endif
359a368,370
>     dims = NULL;
>     vdims = NULL;

389a401,403
>       dims  = malloc(ndims * sizeof(struct ncdim));
>       vdims = malloc(ndims * sizeof(size_t));
>     }
508a523,526
>                   if (dims)
>                     free(dims);
>                   if (vdims)
>                     free(vdims);
519a538,541
>     if (dims)
>       free(dims);
>     if (vdims)
>       free(vdims);

3. When running the netcdf tests, you may have to do "unlimit
stacksize" to avoid some failures due to the increased define sizes
above.
