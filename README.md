# GMV
GMV (General Mesh Viewer) repository for GPLv3 source code, managed by CPFD Software.

Update as of 2016-10-12 by Tony Jones, CPFD Software, LLC.: 
 
    Tony Jones worked with Frank Ortega of LANL over the years 
    to provide enhancements, fixes, and other changes to GMV, 
    including porting of GMV to work via Cygwin in Windows.   
    Frank Ortega passed away suddenly on December 11, 2012.   
    Tony Jones has since been the sole maintainer for GMV on  
    behalf of CPFD Software, and has worked with LANL to provide  
    a path forward for GMV. 
    LANL agreed to open source GMV under GPL v3 in April, 2013, 
    allowing CPFD Software to maintain the source code and  
    distribute GMV. 
    LANL License Agreement Number: 09-C02641 
     
    Since then, Tony Jones has made mostly fixes and some 
    improvements to GMV.  The current state of the code is  
    stable and GMV is still used heavily by CPFD Software. 
 
    Code was previously kept in an internal CPFD Software  
    subversion repository, and sent via zipped source packages 
    per GPL v3 requirements.  It is now being hosted on GitHub. 
     
    Please note that GMV is now protected under the GPL v3  
    license, and is copyright of Los Alamos National Laboratory.   
    All software is provided "AS IS", without warranty of any  
    kind.  CPFD Software cannot provide support for GMV.
